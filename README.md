# ComboTree
 An alternative to Unitys Mecanim for a combo focused combatsystem made using the GraphView and Playables APIs.
# Features
### Mecanim Compatible
ComboTree is not meant to replace but rather extend Mecanim, for parts of your statemachine that you need more controll over. 
This allows you keep your more complex state logic whilst still having the option to flexibly transition.
### Runtime Editing
Because ComboTree was made using the Playables API you can easily alter the graph by:
- transitioning to a new animationclip
- transitioning to a new state
- changing the graph completely
### Eventbased Transition
Unlike Mecanim, the Combo Tree transitions are are eventbased and will execute once an external source triggers them.
